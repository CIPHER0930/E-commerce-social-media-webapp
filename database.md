 <!--
    Login: You can store user credentials in the Firebase Realtime Database, such as their email address and password. This allows you to authenticate users when they try to log in to your application.
    Signup: You can also use the Firebase Realtime Database to store user registration data, such as their name, username, and profile picture. This allows you to create new users and track their activity in your application.
    Dashboard: You can use the Firebase Realtime Database to store dashboard data, such as user activity, statistics, and settings. This allows you to track the performance of your application and make changes as needed.

Here is an example of how you could use the Firebase Realtime Database to store user credentials:

// Create a reference to the user credentials node.
const userCredentialsRef = firebase.database().ref('users/credentials');

// Create a new user credential object.
const userCredential = {
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password123'
};

// Save the user credential object to the database.
userCredentialsRef.set(userCredential);

Here is an example of how you could use the Firebase Realtime Database to store user registration data:

// Create a reference to the user registration node.
const userRegistrationRef = firebase.database().ref('users/registration');

// Create a new user registration object.
const userRegistration = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  username: 'johndoe',
  profilePictureUrl: 'https://example.com/profile_picture.png'
};

// Save the user registration object to the database.
userRegistrationRef.set(userRegistration);

Here is an example of how you could use the Firebase Realtime Database to store dashboard data:

// Create a reference to the dashboard data node.
const dashboardDataRef = firebase.database().ref('dashboard/data');

// Save the dashboard data to the database.
dashboardDataRef.set({
  userActivity: {
    totalLogins: 10,
    mostRecentLogin: '2023-07-15T14:46:35Z'
  },
  statistics: {
    totalUsers: 100,
    averageSessionDuration: 10 minutes
  },
  settings: {
    timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles'
  }
});

These are just a few examples of how you could use the Firebase Realtime Database for login, signup, and dashboard. -->
